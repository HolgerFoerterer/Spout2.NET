## OpenGL examples

Windows

Windows examples do not depend on any OpenGL framework and are based on basic applications for Visual Studio that use the Win32 API. The project solution files for Visual Studio 2022 can be opened immediately and are a good start to get an overview of sending and receiving methods.

ofSpoutExample

OpenFrameworks examples are more comprehensive and demonstrate OpenGL texture send/receive as well as options such as synchronisation, data exchange and utility functions. All examples are well commented. Refer to "ofSpoutExample\readme.md" for further detail.

Cinder

For Cinder, refer to "readme-first.md" in the "Cinder\FboBasic" folder.\
