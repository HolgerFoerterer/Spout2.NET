## OpenGL examples

### Windows

Windows examples are based on basic applications generated by Visual Studio that use the Win32 API.\
They do not depend on any OpenGL framework and are a good start to get an overview of sending and receiving methods.\
The project solution files for Visual Studio 2022 can be opened immediately for source code review and build.

### ofSpoutExample

OpenFrameworks examples are more comprehensive and demonstrate OpenGL texture send/receive as well as options such as synchronisation, data exchange and utility functions. All examples are well commented. Refer to "ofSpoutExample\readme.md" for further detail.

### Cinder

For Cinder, refer to "readme-first.md" in the "Cinder\FboBasic" folder.\
